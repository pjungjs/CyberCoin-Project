# CyberCoin-Project
My 1st Front-end Portfolio Project from Pursuit 9.4 Class Module 2.
A website where you can see the live updates of Cryptocurrencies datas.

---
## How it works
The code is set up to run every 3 seconds.

On the top of the page, you can see the navigation bar.
**Home** - Go to the main page.
**Resources** - Website's data informations, such as API, Bootstrap, etc.
**About** - Short biography of Me and the link to my GitHub as well as this project repository.
**Top** - To go to the top of the page.
**Bottom** - To go to the bottom of the page.

And in the center of the page, you can see the Crypto Live Update table, updating every 3 seconds as stated above.
It's organized by its _Ranking number_, _Coin name_, _current Price_, _Market Cap_, _Volume in 24hrs_ and _Change Percentage in 24hrs_, **all in USD**.
It changes the color. To <u>black</u> if the price remains the same, to <u>green</u> if the price went up, and to <u>red</u> if the price went down from previos to current value.

## Features that I'm currently working on
* submit button, getting the user's input data to search the result accordingly.
* implement the chart to display on the user search's result.
* get all the images of the each cryptocurrencies and display it successfully besides of its name. (Currently I have few images, but still working on how to filter through the images on the local folder with the value that I get from the user, and then finally display it.)
* improve the style of the pages.
* have pagination on the bottom of the main page, so it doesn't show all top 100 raking crypto, but only about 25 of them, then the rest redirect to the next pages.
* etc.

## Ideas for Future Implementations
* Implement the user's registrations system.
* Add "my favorites" page, so the user can quickly view the one's that it's interested.
* etc.
